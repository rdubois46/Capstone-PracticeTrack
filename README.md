# Capstone-PracticeTrack

This application allows a musician to easily document, save, and retrieve/view their practice data. For any musician who wants to develop the habit of regularly tracking their practice and/or develop a better understanding of their practice trends and habits, this app aims to help them accomplish those goals. 

It allows for the creation of unique user accounts. Each user can add their own instruments and associated skills. A user can then document the amount of time they spent on each skill during a given practice session. These sessions are saved in a database, which the user can view at any time. The user can view trends and comparisons in their practice habits over different periods of time.
